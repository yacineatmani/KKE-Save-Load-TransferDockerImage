To transfer the Docker image `cluster:xfusion` from App Server 1 to App Server 3, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Save the Docker image on App Server 1
1. SSH into App Server 1.

   ```bash
   ssh user@app-server-1
   ```

2. Save the Docker image `cluster:xfusion` as a tar archive.

   ```bash
   docker save -o /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar cluster:xfusion
   ```

   - `-o /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar`: Specifies the output file for the saved image.

### Step 2: Transfer the image archive to App Server 3
1. Use `scp` to transfer the image archive from App Server 1 to App Server 3.

   ```bash
   scp /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar user@app-server-3:/tmp/
   ```

   - Replace `user` with the appropriate username for the servers.
   - `/tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar`: Path to the image archive on App Server 1.
   - `user@app-server-3:/tmp/`: Destination path on App Server 3.

### Step 3: Load the image archive on App Server 3
1. SSH into App Server 3.

   ```bash
   ssh user@app-server-3
   ```

2. Load the Docker image from the archive.

   ```bash
   docker load -i /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar
   ```

   - `-i /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar`: Specifies the input file for loading the image.

3. Verify that the image is loaded with the correct name and tag.

   ```bash
   docker images | grep cluster
   ```

   You should see `cluster:xfusion` listed among the Docker images.

### Step 4: (Optional) Cleanup
1. You can remove the tar archive from both servers if it's no longer needed:

   On App Server 1:

   ```bash
   rm /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar
   ```

   On App Server 3:

   ```bash
   rm /tmp/cluster_xfusion.tar
   ```

This process effectively transfers the Docker image from one server to another, ensuring that it can be used for testing or other purposes on App Server 3.
